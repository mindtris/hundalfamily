title: Historians and geneticists may carry out genealogical research
author: author-1
description: The introduction of postgraduate courses in genealogy in recent
  years has given genealogy more of an academic focus, with the emergence of
  peer-reviewed journals in this area. Scholarly genealogy is beginning to
  emerge as a discipline in its own right, with an increasing number of
  individuals who have obtained genealogical qualifications carrying out
  research on a diverse range of topics related to genealogy, both within
  academic institutions and independently.  Historically, in Western societies,
  the focus of genealogy was on the kinship and descent of rulers and nobles,
  often arguing or demonstrating the legitimacy of claims to wealth and power.
  The term often overlapped with heraldry, in which the ancestry of royalty was
  reflected in their coats of arms.
