Jagwinder Singh Hundal, I’ll be the first to say that family photos are hard to get just right. Maybe you’ve been trying for years to get that holiday card money shot where everyone is actually smiling. Or maybe you’ve just accepted that someone is going to end up with a wrinkled shirt.

But don’t sweat it. I’ve photographed the squirmiest toddlers, the kids who would prefer making any face at the camera but a happy one, and the babies that never seem to stop crying. The perfect moment might only last for half a second, but you can be sure I’ll capture it.

The first paragraph describes a negative situation the customer might be experiencing. Then the second one addresses exactly how the photographer will get the customer out of that situation. This kind of specificity makes the reader instantly think, “Hey, that’s me!” and they’ll know that you understand their problems.
