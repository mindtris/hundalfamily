## A Brief Historical Background:

Waheguru Ji ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh!
<br>

<p>In 1706, Guru Gobind Singh jee sent Baba Banda Singh Bahader, along with five other Sikh warriors, from Nanded South (Hazoor Sahib) to Punjab to fight against oppression. Baba Banda Singh Bahader reached Punjab and launched a campaign against the tyranny of the government. He won many battles from the tyrants and gave appropriate punishments to the enemies of Guru Ghar. As a result of this campaign, he established the Khalsa Raj and minted the Khalsa coin. Baba Banda Singh Bahader's performance shook the Delhi government. The government sent a large army against Baba ji and in 1716 AD, the royal army surrounded him in the fort of Gurdas Nangal. For nine months, Singhs remained besieged in the fort starved and under gruesome conditions. Eventually, Baba Banda Singh Bahader was arrested along with about 700 others Singhs. All of them were taken to Delhi and tortured to death. After this, oppression of the Singhs by the Mughul government continued and Singhs kept retaliating in small groups.</p>

## 1733 Nawab Kapur Singh and Jageer:

<p>The bravery of the Singhs and their spirit of ultimate sacrifice remained a thorn in the side of the government. Both sides suffered heavy casualties and financial losses during the war. The government was making every effort to capture or kill the Singhs, but all its efforts were in vain. Perhaps, the government did not know that it is not easy to eliminate an enemy who does not hesitate to self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Eventually, Zakariya Khan, the viceroy of Lahore, reached out to the Singhs through his official Subeg Singh and offered a peace treaty. In this offer, he promised to give the title of Nawab to the commander of the nation and a jageer of one lakh rupees. Due to the continuous campaigns, the number of Singhs at that time had declined considerably. To consolidate their strengths, they wanted to live in peace for a while. The Singhs, recognizing the urgency of the time, made a resolution (gurmta) and accepted Zakariya Khan's offer. Sardar Kapoor Singh was chosen for the title of Nawab. Same as other false promises by the government, this one also turned out to be hollow promise and as soon as the opportunity came next year, Zakariya khan weaseled out of his promise.</p>
