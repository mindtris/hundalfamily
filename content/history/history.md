title: ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ ਜੀ ਕਾ ਖ਼ਾਲਸਾ ਵਾਹਿਗੁਰੂ ਜੀ ਕੀ ਫ਼ਤਿਹ!

## A Brief Historical Background:

<p>In 1706, Guru Gobind Singh jee sent Baba Banda Singh Bahader, along with five other Sikh warriors, from Nanded South (Hazoor Sahib) to Punjab to fight against oppression. Baba Banda Singh Bahader reached Punjab and launched a campaign against the tyranny of the government. He won many battles from the tyrants and gave appropriate punishments to the enemies of Guru Ghar. As a result of this campaign, he established the Khalsa Raj and minted the Khalsa coin. Baba Banda Singh Bahader's performance shook the Delhi government. The government sent a large army against Baba ji and in 1716 AD, the royal army surrounded him in the fort of Gurdas Nangal. For nine months, Singhs remained besieged in the fort starved and under gruesome conditions. Eventually, Baba Banda Singh Bahader was arrested along with about 700 others Singhs. All of them were taken to Delhi and tortured to death. After this, oppression of the Singhs by the Mughul government continued and Singhs kept retaliating in small groups.</p>

## 1733 Nawab Kapur Singh and Jageer:

<p>The bravery of the Singhs and their spirit of ultimate sacrifice remained a thorn in the side of the government. Both sides suffered heavy casualties and financial losses during the war. The government was making every effort to capture or kill the Singhs, but all its efforts were in vain. Perhaps, the government did not know that it is not easy to eliminate an enemy who does not hesitate to self-sacrifice.</p>

<p>Eventually, Zakariya Khan, the viceroy of Lahore, reached out to the Singhs through his official Subeg Singh and offered a peace treaty. In this offer, he promised to give the title of Nawab to the commander of the nation and a jageer of one lakh rupees. Due to the continuous campaigns, the number of Singhs at that time had declined considerably. To consolidate their strengths, they wanted to live in peace for a while. The Singhs, recognizing the urgency of the time, made a resolution (gurmta) and accepted Zakariya Khan's offer. Sardar Kapoor Singh was chosen for the title of Nawab. Same as other false promises by the government, this one also turned out to be hollow promise and as soon as the opportunity came next year, Zakariya khan weaseled out of his promise.</p>

## **1734 Baisakhi -formation of 2 Dals and 5 Jathas:**

<p>Understanding the time and circumstances, Sardar Kapoor Singh invited as many Jathas as possible for the Baisakhi gathering in 1734. In this gathering, two Dals (groups) of Singhs were formed. One of which was called 'Tarna Dal' and the other 'Budda Dal'. The Budda Dal was entrusted with the care of gurduaras and families. Five more jathas were formed out of the Tarna Dal and they were given the responsibility of fighting against oppression and tyranny. Kapoor Singh retained command of both Dals.</p>

## 1734 Invitations to Singhs by Bhai Mani Singh for gathering in Amritsar during Diwali festival:

<p>Bhai Mani Singh sent invitations to the Singhs from far and wide for a gathering during Diwali festival for a period of ten days. For this Summit, he agreed to pay the fee of five thousand stamps imposed by the government. The Governor of Lahore, seizing the opportunity, began plotting to assassinate the Singhs who would come to the gathering. When Bhai Mani Singh became aware of his plans, he canceled the meeting, realizing the danger. He sent messages to the Singhs not to come to Amritsar. Despite this, some of the Singhs who had already come were captured and martyred. The government was furious with the decision of Bhai Mani Singh Ji, so he too was arrested and martyred.</p>

## 1739 Singhs move towards Malwa region, invasion of Nader Shah:

<p>After the martyrdom of Bhai Mani Singh Ji and other Singhs, the wrath of the government against the Khalsa increased. For the safety of the families, most of the Singhs, led by Kapoor Singh, moved to Malwa (region), where they greatly increased their numbers by spreading the message of Amrit (Pauhl). Combat training continued at the same time. The number of Jathas increased from about sixty to sixty-five. In 1739, Nader Shah invaded India and plundered as far as up to Delhi. When he was returning to Afghanistan with the booty (looted goods), the Singhs engaged in guerrilla war with his armies and raided the looted goods and released the captured women and helped them to get to their respective homes.</p>

## March 29, 1748 Baisakhi Amritsar, Beginning of Misls, Jassa Singh Ahluwalia and Arrival of Ahmad Shah Abdali: 

<p>In 1748, Ahmed Shah Abdali invaded India for the first time. He had many skirmishes with the Singhs. On 29 March 1748, on the day of Baisakhi, Sardar Kapoor Singh convened a large gathering of Budda Dal and Tarna Dal at Amritsar. On this occasion, through a resolution (Gurmata), a plan was drawn up to organize the jathas in a more efficient manner.  This is where the misls started. Eleven misls were formed under the leadership of eminent chiefs:</p>
